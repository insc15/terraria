NHẬT KÝ THAY ĐỔI
=============================================v1.0.2=================================================
* Update việt hoá item và npc mới:
Terraria 1.4.1 New Content and Content Changes:

A. New Content and Changes
	Added the winners of the Terraria Vanity Contest:
		Plaguebringer
		Wandering Ronin
		The Timeless Traveler
		Floret Protector
		Capricorn
		Bonus winner: TV Head!
		All six of these are craftable with pre-Hardmode materials of various sorts, so that all players can experience these awesome vanity sets! Thanks to everyone who participated and voted in the Vanity contest, and especially to our winners!
	Added new Achievements
	Added a credit sequence and music track following Moon Lord's defeat for the first time. This can also be accessed from the main menu.
	Music Box (Journey's End) is now created by recording the Credits music sequence. Additionally, using it in a normal accessory slot will play the Credits in-game, while using it in a social slot will only play the music.
	Added a new Princess NPC, with a variety of related items (and a new hairstyle!)
	Added new early game Summon equipment: Flinx Fur Coat and the Flinx Staff!
	Added a new pre-Hardmode whip, craftable at Dungeon-tier
	Added a Lavaproof Fishing Hook + Angler Tackle Bag Tinker
	Bee Hives and Antlion Eggs can now be crafted and placed
	Added a "Rainbow Cursor" vanity accessory

B. Vanity Accessory Changes
	Ultrabright Helmet now supports visible hair when worn
	Armors and vanity items which draw on the back (backpacks, tails, wings, and capes) are now no longer mutually exclusive. This means that you can now have one of any of those four categories all displaying at the same time. Previously, only one of those could ever be visible at a time (for instance, if you had visible wings, you could not ever see a cape, backpack, or tail).
	Combat Wrench now displays on the player regardless of what other backpacks are currently shown (it is its own category of back-draw)
	Angel Halo now functions like Unicorn Horn, in that it will be visible regardless of any other head equipment or vanity that is equipped
	Accessories which draw on the head have also been split into several subgroups, which will allow several of them to be worn simultaneously. For example, Blindfold/Spectre Goggles in the eye slot, Nature's Gift/Obsidian Rose in the "flower" slot and Ginger Beard.
	Blindfold can now be visibly seen when wearing hats/helmets which show the face
	Wearing Diving Helmet-series accessories set to visible will override your helmet, allowing them to be seen instead of your helmet
	Obsidian Skull-series accessories that are set to visible are now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face, as it will replace your face with the skull. Due to the shape of the Skull not fitting standard "Terrarian face" shapes, on certain helmets, it will use a different sprite with a more standard layout. You can also wear virtually all physically compatible Head/Face accessories with the Obsidian Skull as well.
	Ginger Beard has been resprited, and if set to visible, is now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face. It is also now compatible with most other Head/Face accessories.
	Reworked Shield/Cape display so that Shields and Capes are now visually compatible with each other again. The Shield now draws "in front" of the Cape, instead of underneath of it, which led to many of the initial issues.
	Shields which are set to not be visible can still be dyed, and will show that dye when actively used (such as Shield of Cthulhu dash or Brand of the Inferno Block). Previously, if they were set to invisible, their active use version would never have dye.
	Long-player hair is now properly compatible with wings/backpacks, and will show the full length of the hair without being cut-off visually
	The special trails left by various types of running boots (Sailfish, Flurry, Flower, etc) are now also subject to vanity usage, and you can use the one you prefer either through re-ordering accessories or using the social slots
	Bone Glove now has visual vanity for the hand slot

C. Other Content/Design Changes
	The Journey Mode duplication menu has been overhauled, with the addition of several new filters to break up some of the larger categories
	Additionally, the Misc option in the duplication menu should more properly encompass items that do not fall under any other category
	Made minor updates to Boss Mask item sprites to match the mask sprites
	Sprite update for Orange/Amber Phasesaber
	Torch God now plays an Otherworldly track when that setting is toggled
	Bestiary now indicates if a drop is Wave-based/if it only drops after a certain wave in Frost Moon and Pumpkin Moon
	Loading Tips now appear when connecting to a server
	Thunder volume is now adjusted with the Ambient SFX settings rather than regular Sound settings (edited)
	Plantero's Sombrero has made its triumphant return
	Reorganized menu settings for resolution/fullscreen/windowed borderless to all use the same sub-menu, to reduce confusion
	Updated FNA (Mac/Linux related)
	Added RGB support for SteelSeries game peripherals
	Adding updated localization for all languages up to 1.4 (some 1.4.1 content may still be untranslated, and these translations will come in an upcoming hotfix)
